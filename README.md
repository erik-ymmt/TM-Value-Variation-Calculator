# TM-Value-Variation-Calculator
Calculates "sell to agent" current and old values based on the RatingR5 (ver5.4 for Season67) local storage.
RatingR5 must be installed and game language must be English.

It helps deciding if a player is worth keeping (financially) or not . In other words, if his "sell to agent" value is growing more than his wage weekly.
